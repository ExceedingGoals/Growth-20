          Hello Everyone!
      I wanted to start off by saying that I am praying for those who are going
a tough time and for those who are doing what they can to stay healthy through
this pandemic. This platform is created for anyone who is willing to ask or
answer the toughest questions about human nature in the world we live in now.
I'm one of many who would like to bridge the dialogue between those who seek
wisdom but do not know where to start and those are inspired to spread their
knowledge among their peers 'WITHOUT JUDGEMENT'.

      This is a work in progress but I still encourage everyone to communicate
and connect. Thank you!
      </body>
